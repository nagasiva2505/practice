Dear Shashi,
I hope you are doing well. I am writing to formally request leave for my wedding on the following dates: March 27th, 28th, and April 1st to 11th.
As this is a significant occasion for me and my family, I would truly appreciate your approval for this leave. I will ensure that all my ongoing tasks are completed in advance, and I will coordinate with my team to ensure a smooth workflow during my absence.
Please let me know if you need any further details. Looking forward to your kind approval.
Best regards,
Ozili Prasanth Kumar
